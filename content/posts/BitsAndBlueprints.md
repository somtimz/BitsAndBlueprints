## Bits and Blueprints

Bits and Blueprints is my informal blog, online scrapbook where I write down and explore ideas.

Its a collection of semi-finished 'notes' on techncial topics of interest to me.

The purpose is to trabslate thoughts, readings and other informaiton in to some tnagilbe items. Writing is one of the best ways to educate and understand any topic.

This blog will have some very techncial content that you might find in a design blueprint.

My areas of interest include:

- AI
- System Design
- Solution Architecture
- IT Strategy
- IT Governance
- Cloud
- Enterprise Architecture
- Product Analysis

Some of this content will be edited and posted to my substack, medium and linkedin accounts.

### Goals and Strategy

The goals of this blog is to capture ideas and thoughts and then refine them. Working in public psychologically motivates to keep the content intersting and accurate.

## Process

My Process with this Blog is to:

- Create a blog entry based on some title. Leave it in draft mode
- Add a few paragraphs of content
- Slowly work the content until the ideas mature
- Turn draft mode off, and soft publish
- For really good content, repost to Medium or some other site

A few good ways to organzine content is the following:

- How to Fail at X: Explain how to make a mess of X. X could be something like adopting microservices, going to the cloud, and so on. Sometimes the best way to succeed is is to focus on failure and just avoid failing strategies.

## Monitoring and Feedback

I don't expect any feedback on this site. More likely feedback will come from various other sites Medium, LinkedIn, Substack
