## Bits and Blueprints

Bits and Blueprints is my informal blog, where I write down and explore ideas.
Its a collection of semi-finished 'notes' on techncial topics of interest to me. I find that writing things is the best way to educate and understand any topic.

This blog will have some very techncial content that you might find in a design blueprint.

My areas of interest include:
- AI
- System Design
- Solution Architecture
- IT Strategy
- IT Governance
- Cloud
- Enterprise Architecture
- Product Analysis


Some of this content will be edited and posted to my substack, medium and linkedin accounts.

My Process with this Blog is to:

A few good ways to organzine content is the follwoing:
