Many digital portfolios in large organizations are poorly designed and constructed. They waste valable resources and often contribute little business value.
What causes this?

1. Ineffective Strategy
2. Lack of Commitment to the Strategy
3. Bad Engagement with Stakeholders
4. Organizational Misalignment
5. Poor Governance
6. Poor Strategic Alignment
7. Bureaucracy & Micro management
8. Belief in the Hype Train
9. Naive Belief in Vendors
10. Lip Service
11. Misuse of products and platforms

Creating a good digital strategy is a lot harder than it appears. The reasons include:

- Complexity: Real world digital portfolios are complex. Just creating a catalogue of components and services is difficult because products and services are purchased and end users employ short term workarounds and fixes to get stuff working. Workarounds often turn out to be permanent and these workarounds are usually not well documented.
- Misunderstanding: Strategy definition is a discipline that everyone thinks they understand, but in most cases don't
- Complacency: Sometimes analysts oversimplify how to define an effective strategy. In the digital realm there are dozens of slogans and buzzwords (cloud, agile, microservices, AI, etc) that sound like strategy but aren't
- Ignorance: Finding out what your portfolio looks like turns out to be an expensive proposition.
- Lack of alignment with the sponsoring business goals and objectives
- Accidental complexity caused by a hodgepodge of applications, products and services that don't make a lot of sense and operate at cross purposes.
- Misplaced Confidence in Consultants: Even if you hire good consultants, they often don't understand your business well enough.

Even if you have a good strategy you need to believe in it, invest in it and commit to it. This means that time and effort is required to educate everyone about what they should understand in detail, what the digital strategy is. And your staff won't believe in the strategy unless you show a commitment to it with budget, staff and resources.

1. The IT organization is often organized in a way that doesn't serve the organization very well. It's not uncommon to have too many support personnel and a severe shortage of designers and architects.

2. One sign of poor commitment is that the organization is not aligned with the strategy. The wrong incentives, skills and roles are in place. Stakeholders operate at cross purposes, because their incentives don't align with the strategy.

A digital portfolio consists of all the digital equipment, systems, applications, products and services in use by a business. It also includes the employees, vendors and suppliers that support it.
In any business of any size, the digital portfolio consists of literally thousands and thousands of items.
Increasingly, a good digital ecosystem is crucial for good business performance. However, in many corporations today there are many practices that in effect destroy and decrease the value of the digital portfolio. Here are the ten most common problems
