Yes, this is a fascinating idea! While it's not a common mainstream method in LLMs, there's definitely merit and ongoing research exploring similar approaches. Here's a breakdown:

**The Concept**

Your intuition is correct – if we realize a past token choice was suboptimal, revising it could lead to a globally better output. This is analogous to how humans sometimes rewrite earlier parts of a sentence as they gain a clearer understanding of their message.

**Models That Do Something Similar**

* **Iterative Refinement Models:**  Some generative models employ iterative refinement. They don't directly 'go back' but might generate multiple drafts of an output and then select or combine the best parts. This indirectly addresses the past choice issue.
* **Search-based Techniques:**  Methods like beam search keep track of multiple possible sequences. A low-probability token early on doesn't mean its corresponding sequence is discarded immediately.  If subsequent predictions turn out incredibly strong, that sequence might still be the winner. 
* **Models with "Editable" Memory:**  There's emerging research on LLMs with memory mechanisms that are more explicitly editable. This could pave the way for directly revising earlier tokens if needed.

**Effectiveness in Practice**

* **Potential Improvement:**  There's strong potential for quality improvement. Human language is highly interconnected – earlier choices significantly constrain what works well later in the text.
* **Computational Cost:**   This is the major issue. Revising a token would likely necessitate re-running inference for all subsequent tokens, which quickly becomes expensive, especially in long sequences.
* **Determining When to Revise:**  It's tricky to decide *when* a past token is bad enough to warrant the computational overhead of a revision.

**Research Directions**

* **Efficient Revision Mechanisms:**  Research could focus on ways to efficiently update the internal state of the model after token revision without a full recalculation.
* **Selective Revision:** Developing heuristics to identify the most crucial tokens likely to benefit from revision, minimizing the computational cost.
* **Hybrid approaches:**  Combining this idea with iterative refinement or search-based techniques might yield a more practical balance.

**Let me know if you'd like links to specific research papers. It's a less mainstream area, but a very interesting one for improving LLM generation!** 

Absolutely! Here's a look at some relevant research directions on revising tokens or improving LLM generation through techniques that indirectly address the problem:

**Direct Token Revision**

* **"Neural Text Degeneration with Iterative Target Text Revision"**  ([https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.90/](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.90/)). This paper explores a method where an LLM is used to both generate text and iteratively revise it, focusing on the problem of text degeneration (where outputs become less coherent).
* **"EDITNTS: An Neural Programmer-Interpreter for Image Editing"** ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02000)). While focused on image editing, the core concept involves a mechanism for revising previous steps. This type of 'editable memory' could inspire LLM research.

**Iterative Refinement and Search-based Approaches**

* **"Creative Text Generation via Iterative Refinement with Multi-step Planning"** ([https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.370/](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.370/)). This explores generating multiple drafts and refining them, demonstrating how a revision-like approach can improve text creativity.
* **Work on Nucleus Sampling (Top-p Sampling), Beam Search, and variations**. These techniques implicitly allow for some 'backtracking' if a previously less-favorable sequence turns out to yield very strong predictions.

**Hybrid and Emerging Work**

* **Combining Reinforcement Learning with Revision** There's potential to use reinforcement learning to train models to identify when and how revisions would be most beneficial.
* **Attention-based Models and "Scratchpads"** Research into giving LLMs a 'scratchpad', or editable workspace, could enable mechanisms closer to how we think and revise text.

**Challenges and Notes**

* This is a relatively niche area compared to mainstream LLM development. Finding papers specifically targeting token revision might be tricky.
* A lot of relevant work falls under areas like iterative refinement, controllable text generation, and techniques to combat LLM degeneration.
