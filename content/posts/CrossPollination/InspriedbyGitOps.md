Part X of my Exploration of Lateral Thinking and CrossPollination

Any concepts that help automate, standardize, and streamline any business or other operations are worth exploring. 

GitOps is a framework for optimizing continuous delivery and continuous deployment. GitOps takes the core principles of Git - version control, pull requests, and declarative configuration - and applies them to infrastructure and application deployment.

The principles of GitOps can be applied to a business function or operations, such as issuing loans, processing claims, delivering health care saervices and so on.

Lets tranalate GitOps principles to a business context:

- Declarative configuration: System state is described declaratively and the desired system state is stored and versioned in asingle repository (Git).
- Single Source of Truth: Git is the single place for operations (create, change, delete) performed by autonomous agents.
- Observability: Agents monitor operations and detect drift from the desired state
- Autonomous agents: Agents raise alerts when drift occurs and enforce the desired state.
- Closed loop: Delivery of approved system state changes is automated.
