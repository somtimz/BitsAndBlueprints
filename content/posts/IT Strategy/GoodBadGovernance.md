ID: Good governance message is widely ....
The message that is heard constantly in corporate IT is the importance of good governance.  

ID: Good governance is uncommon...
However, more often than not, the governance, I see in place is anything but good. Good governance is widely misunderstood and often implemented poorly as a result. 

Bad governance is unfortunately a giant reason why so much investment in technology is wasted and one reason that corporate IT is often not a signifcant player when corporate strategy is being defined and formulated.

I always find it very helpful to contrast and compare the two poles of any issue. The good and the bad



## Common Problems

The problems arise from errors in:

- Mission and Vision
- Governance Organization and Structure
- Strategy and Policy Specification and Management
- Communication
- Monitoring and Tracking

## Mission and Vision

Many, many companies seem to feel that the purpose of governance is to police and monitor IT projects. But this is wrong. Good governance should be focused on aligning IT initiatives with the organization's mission, vision, and strategic objectives.

Effective governance provides:

| Bad Governance | Good Governance |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Focus on policing and enforcement | Focus on empowering managers and staff|
| Focus on small, tactical project decisions | Focus on aligning IT initiatives with the organization's mission, vision, and strategic objectives |
| Focus on items that are not strategic | Focus on dealing with the most impactful and risky decisions |
| The mission, vision and goals are muddled and unclear. Ambiguity and confusion reign | Clear purpose and objectives that are tied to the organization's mission and vision are defined. Gaps are identified and addressed|
| Authority to act is lacking. Decisions can't or won't be made and can't or win't be enforced | The Governance bodies have the appropriate authority and decision-making power to make impactful decisions|
| Lack of adequate representation from domain and other experts | Important stakeholders are represented and have a clear say in the decision making process |
| Rigid perspective and approach | Recognition that life is complex and so are IT products and services|
|Winging it: ITs assumed that project members will understand and make good governance decisions. | Sometimes you get lucky and you have personnel who fully undertand corporate strategy and objectives and are well aligned with them. Governance is deliberately managed and well planned |




Effective governance provides:


Topics:
- Purpose
- Alignment
- Authority
- Commitment

Other Problems:

An overmphasis on control and security.

## Governance Organization and Structure

- Governance is not 

## Strategy and Policy Specification and Management

One common mistake I see in many places are weak, confusing or missing standards and policies.

Effective governance requires well-defined, clear and aligned policies and standards that provide guidance to architects, developers and project managers.

## Communication and Collaboration

## Monitoring and Tracking


## I see are as follows:

- Policy Related
  - Lack of Alignment: Policies and standards are not aligned with the organization's mission, vision, and strategic objectives.
  - Poor Principles, Policies and Standards: Policies are quite often incomplete, poorly drafted or not fit for the purpose of architects, developers and project managers
  - Complexity: Every IT standard or policy has one or more flaws which either appear at the time they are drafted or as the environment changes
- Execution Related
  - Governance requires planning. Projects are often executed without proper governance planning, leading to poor outcomes. You can't simply show up at a governance meeting two weeks prior to deployment and expect to get good governance
  - Limited Perspective: Good governance takes all stakeholder interests and concerns into account.

## Good Governance in a Nutshell

Governance is not about managing portfolios or projects, its about helping those who do manage applicaiton and technology portfolios and projects to make the right decisions.
