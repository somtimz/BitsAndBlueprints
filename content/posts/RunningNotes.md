My technical diary on what I'm learning about AI, the Cloud, System design, Programming(Python, React, Node, Spring), and strategy.


## RAG - Multimodal and More

- RAG Foundations
- RAg Enhancements
- RAG and LLM Integrations

### RAG Retrieval

Two types of retrieval

1. Sparse retrieval (ie BM25)
2. Dense retrival (ie Vector embedding)


## Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are a family of deep generative models that can create realistic and diverse samples of data, such as images, texts and videos.
Diffusion models work by gradually adding noise to data until it becomes random, then reversing
the process to generate new data from noise. This process is based on probabilistic modeling and neural networks.

Diffusion models mainly have three equivalent formulations:
1. denoising diffusion probabilistic models
2. scorebased generative models
3. stochastic differential equations
