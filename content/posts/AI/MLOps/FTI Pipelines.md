MLOps is about automated testing, versioning, and monitoring of ML artifacts.

(![alt FTI Pipeline](<FTI Pipeline.png>))

It takes significant engineering effort to test and validate ML Systems  to make them safe!

The models need to be tested for performance, but also for a lack of bias against known groups of vulnerable users. Finally, at the top of the pyramid, ML-Systems need to test their performance with A/B tests before they can switch to use a new model.
