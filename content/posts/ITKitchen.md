## Corporate IT is Like a Home Kitchen 

Internal IT departments are like the home cook that prepares the meals for the family.

What you will find:

- Everyone will complain about your cooking and the meals you make. A few thank yous is all you can expect
- Everyone will want their own special meals. One person will want vegetarian only, and another will demand more meat. Evertone will ask for more spicy or less spicy.
  - Will ask for meals that are hard to make, take hours to cook, require expensive ingredients, not in season, etc
- Some of the family will skip dinner altogether and eat out or eat at their friend's house. Their dinner will go to waste
- Some of the family will let their dinner get cold (and then complain about it)
- Everyone will give you their recipes
  - May start cooking with YOUR kitchen, ingredients, using your pots and pans
- Noone Won't help clean up and wash the dishes
- Your kitchen equipment is getting old, becuase noone wants to pay for a new stove or a new set of pots and pans
- 

Ideas:
- You are a decent cook, with a small kitchen with most of the equipment you need
  - But 
    - You know how to cook a few really nice meals. You are not a chef
    - You don't have a lot of fancy equipment; some of your equipment is getting really old
    - You don't have unlmited time and funds to prepare meals
- Everyone will complain about your cooking
- Everyone wants their own favorites ('I don't like stew, I want mor meat in my stew, it's too spicy, etc)
  - Some will demand a SPECIAL meal
    - Some will demand complicated, expensive meals requiring special equipment and ingredients
    - Others will demand the SAME meals every day (won't eat ANYTHING, they are not used to)
- Will insist on their own methods or recipes:
  - A: It needs MORE spice, B: It needs less spice, You: ??
  - A: I need my protein, B: I'm a vegetarian, You: C: 
- Wont eat your cooking. They will:
  - Munch on junk food
  - Do take out or delivery
  - Go to a restaurant
  - Eat at their friend's house
  - Start cooking on their own
    - May get their own kitchen, equipment and ingredients OR use YOURS
- Timing: Everyone wants to eat at different times
- Wasted ingredients: 
  - I bought a beautiful 'fish', but no one will eat it
  - I bought meat, but it went bad before i could use it
- Missing ingredients
  - I'm ready to cook, but we ran out of ingredient X and can't get it until tommorrow
- - Too many cooks
