      <description>Q to Gemini: Suppose during inference we are at token 65, but it turns out token 23 now has a low probability. There is now a much better token that should be chosen for token 23. Does it make sense to update toekn 23 and throw away all the tokens after token 23 and restart the inference? Do any models do this? How effective would this&#xA;Gemini A: Yes, this is a fascinating idea!</description>

      <description>Status: Content: 10% Editing 10% Value: Medium&#xA;TODO: Look up arxiv paper on good/bad prompt engineering&#xA;Good prompt engineering is the simplest most accessible way to get value from AI models.&#xA;Guide to Prompting Make prompts as clear and concise as possible Clarify or remove ambiguities. Ensure the who, what, where, why and how are explicit and clearly defined Keep prompts short as feasible Be wary of the lost in the middle effect of long context windows Long prompts are both slower and more expensive than long prompts Add content to the context if it will help with the answer Use prompt completion pairs in the context to provide few shot learning examples Leverage the prompt structures Use the roles that models provide Leverage the system, userr and assistant roles Use instructions to guide the prompt completion Prefer to give instrucitons raher than ask questions Not what is the heaviest element, but&amp;gt; Complete the sentence:&#xD;The heaviest element commonly found in nature is: Your instructions should be at the front for short prompts and at the end for long prompts Use Chain of Thought or Reason Step by Step Experiment with prompts.</description>
