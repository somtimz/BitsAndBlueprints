<p>Bits and Blueprints is my informal blog, online scrapbook where I write down and explore ideas.</p>
<p>Its a collection of semi-finished &rsquo;notes&rsquo; on techncial topics of interest to me.</p>
<p>The purpose is to trabslate thoughts, readings and other informaiton in to some tnagilbe items. Writing is one of the best ways to educate and understand any topic.</p>
<p>This blog will have some very techncial content that you might find in a design blueprint.</p>
<p>My areas of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI</li>
<li>System Design</li>
<li>Solution Architecture</li>
<li>IT Strategy</li>
<li>IT Governance</li>
<li>Cloud</li>
<li>Enterprise Architecture</li>
<li>Product Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this content will be edited and posted to my substack, medium and linkedin accounts.</p>
<h3 id="goals-and-strategy">Goals and Strategy</h3>
<p>The goals of this blog is to capture ideas and thoughts and then refine them. Working in public psychologically motivates to keep the content intersting and accurate.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>My Process with this Blog is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a blog entry based on some title. Leave it in draft mode</li>
<li>Add a few paragraphs of content</li>
<li>Slowly work the content until the ideas mature</li>
<li>Turn draft mode off, and soft publish</li>
<li>For really good content, repost to Medium or some other site</li>
</ul>
<p>A few good ways to organzine content is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to Fail at X: Explain how to make a mess of X. X could be something like adopting microservices, going to the cloud, and so on. Sometimes the best way to succeed is is to focus on failure and just avoid failing strategies.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monitoring-and-feedback">Monitoring and Feedback</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect any feedback on this site. More likely feedback will come from various other sites Medium, LinkedIn, Substack</p>
