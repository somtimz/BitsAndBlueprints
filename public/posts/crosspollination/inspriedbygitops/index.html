<p>Any concepts that help automate, standardize, and streamline any business or other operations are worth exploring.</p>
<p>GitOps is a framework for optimizing continuous delivery and continuous deployment. GitOps takes the core principles of Git - version control, pull requests, and declarative configuration - and applies them to infrastructure and application deployment.</p>
<p>The principles of GitOps can be applied to a business function or operations, such as issuing loans, processing claims, delivering health care saervices and so on.</p>
<p>Lets tranalate GitOps principles to a business context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declarative configuration: System state is described declaratively and the desired system state is stored and versioned in asingle repository (Git).</li>
<li>Single Source of Truth: Git is the single place for operations (create, change, delete) performed by autonomous agents.</li>
<li>Observability: Agents monitor operations and detect drift from the desired state</li>
<li>Autonomous agents: Agents raise alerts when drift occurs and enforce the desired state.</li>
<li>Closed loop: Delivery of approved system state changes is automated.</li>
</ul>
