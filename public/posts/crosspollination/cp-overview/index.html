<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-pollination:</strong> The transfer of ideas between different fields to produce new insights and solutions. It emphasizes the fruitful exchange that can occur across disciplines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge Transfer:</strong> Knowledge transfer focuses on the deliberate application of knowledge or practices from one domain to another to solve a problem or create something new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogical Reasoning:</strong> This describes the cognitive process of identifying similarities between two seemingly unrelated things. It&rsquo;s how we make connections and use concepts from one area to understand or innovate in another. This is what brainstorming often tries to achieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interdisciplinary Approach:</strong> This is a broader concept about the practice of combining multiple fields of knowledge to address complex problems or questions. It often involves borrowing concepts or methods from other disciplines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive Reuse:</strong>  Often used in architecture and urban planning, this refers to taking an existing structure or concept originally designed for one purpose and re-purposing it for an entirely different use. This can apply to ideas as well as physical objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lateral Thinking:</strong>  A problem-solving technique encouraging the exploration of indirect and seemingly illogical approaches. It often involves looking to other fields for unusual inspiration and solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conceptual Blending:</strong>  This linguistic and cognitive theory describes how the mind takes elements from different mental spaces (ideas, concepts, etc.) and combines them into new structures. This blending can happen consciously or unconsciously, often with innovations arising from combining concepts previously thought unrelated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bisociation:</strong>  Coined by author Arthur Koestler, it refers to the act of holding two different concepts or frames of reference in your mind simultaneously. The tension between these disparate ideas can spark insightful connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medicine borrows the concept of &lsquo;debugging&rsquo; from computer science</strong> to describe the process of diagnosing and solving complex medical problems.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture adopts the biological concept of self-healing materials</strong> to design structures that can repair themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Business strategy applies principles from military history and tactics</strong> to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</li>
</ul>
