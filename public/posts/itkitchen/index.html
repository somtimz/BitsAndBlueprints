<p>Internal IT departments are like the home cook that prepares the meals for the family.</p>
<p>What you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone will complain about your cooking and the meals you make. A few thank yous is all you can expect</li>
<li>Everyone will want their own special meals. One person will want vegetarian only, and another will demand more meat. Evertone will ask for more spicy or less spicy.
<ul>
<li>Will ask for meals that are hard to make, take hours to cook, require expensive ingredients, not in season, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some of the family will skip dinner altogether and eat out or eat at their friend&rsquo;s house. Their dinner will go to waste</li>
<li>Some of the family will let their dinner get cold (and then complain about it)</li>
<li>Everyone will give you their recipes
<ul>
<li>May start cooking with YOUR kitchen, ingredients, using your pots and pans</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Noone Won&rsquo;t help clean up and wash the dishes</li>
<li>Your kitchen equipment is getting old, becuase noone wants to pay for a new stove or a new set of pots and pans</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a decent cook, with a small kitchen with most of the equipment you need
<ul>
<li>But
<ul>
<li>You know how to cook a few really nice meals. You are not a chef</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have a lot of fancy equipment; some of your equipment is getting really old</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have unlmited time and funds to prepare meals</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everyone will complain about your cooking</li>
<li>Everyone wants their own favorites (&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like stew, I want mor meat in my stew, it&rsquo;s too spicy, etc)
<ul>
<li>Some will demand a SPECIAL meal
<ul>
<li>Some will demand complicated, expensive meals requiring special equipment and ingredients</li>
<li>Others will demand the SAME meals every day (won&rsquo;t eat ANYTHING, they are not used to)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Will insist on their own methods or recipes:
<ul>
<li>A: It needs MORE spice, B: It needs less spice, You: ??</li>
<li>A: I need my protein, B: I&rsquo;m a vegetarian, You: C:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wont eat your cooking. They will:
<ul>
<li>Munch on junk food</li>
<li>Do take out or delivery</li>
<li>Go to a restaurant</li>
<li>Eat at their friend&rsquo;s house</li>
<li>Start cooking on their own
<ul>
<li>May get their own kitchen, equipment and ingredients OR use YOURS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Timing: Everyone wants to eat at different times</li>
<li>Wasted ingredients:
<ul>
<li>I bought a beautiful &lsquo;fish&rsquo;, but no one will eat it</li>
<li>I bought meat, but it went bad before i could use it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missing ingredients
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m ready to cook, but we ran out of ingredient X and can&rsquo;t get it until tommorrow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Too many cooks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
